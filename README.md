Description
-----------

*r.estimap.recreation* is an implementation of the ESTIMAP recreation algorithm to
support mapping and modelling of ecosystem services (Zulian, 2014).

Examples
--------

For the sake of demonstrating the usage of the module, we use the
following "component" maps

-   area_of_interest
-   land_suitability
-   water_resources
-   protected_areas

(available to download at: ...) to derive a recreation *potential* map.

<div>

![Example of a water resources input map](images/r_estimap_recreation_water_resources.png) ![Example
of a protected areas input map](images/r_estimap_recreation_protected_areas.png)

</div>

Before anything, we need to define the extent of interest using

<div class="code">

    g.region  raster=area_of_interest

</div>

### Using pre-processed maps

The first four input options of the module are designed to receive
pre-processed input maps that classify as either `land`, `natural`,
`water` and `infrastructure` resources.

#### Potential

To compute a *potential* output map, the simplest possible command call
requires the user to define the input map option `land` and define a
name for the output map option `potential`. Using a pre-processed map
that depicts the suitability of different land types to support for
recreation (here the map named
`land_suitability) the command to execute is: `

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  land=land_suitability  potential=potential

</div>

![Example of a recreation potential output map](images/r_estimap_recreation_potential.png)

Note, this will process the input map `land_suitability` over the extent
defined previously via `g.region`, which is the standard behaviour in
GRASS GIS.

To exclude certain areas from the computations, we may use a raster map
as a mask and feed it to the input map option `mask`:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  land=land_suitability  mask=area_of_interest  potential=potential_1

</div>

![Example of a recreation potential output map while using a
MASK](images/r_estimap_recreation_potential_1.png)

The use of a mask (in GRASS GIS' terminology known as **MASK**) will
ignore areas of **No Data** (pixels in the `area_of_interest` map
assigned the NULL value). Successively, these areas will be empty in the
output map `potential_1`. Actually, the same effect can be achieved by
using GRASS GIS' native mask creation module `r.mask` and feed it with a
raster map of interest. The result will be a raster map named **MASK**
whose presence acts as a filter. In the following examples, it becomes
obvious that if a single input map features such **No Data** areas, they
will be propagated in the output map.

Nonetheless, it is good practice to use a `MASK` when one needs to
ensure the exclusion of undesired areas from any computations. Also,
note the `--o` flag: it is required to overwrite the already existing
map named `potential_1`.

Next, we add a water component, a map named `water_resources`, modify
the output map name to `potential_2` and execute again, without a mask:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  land=land_suitability  water=water_resources  potential=potential_2

</div>

![Example of a recreation potential output map while using a MASK, a
land suitability map and a water resources map](images/r_estimap_recreation_potential_2.png)

At this point it becomes clear that all `NULL` cells present in the
"water" map, are proagated in the output map `potential_2`.

Following, we provide a map of protected areas named `protected_areas`,
modify the output map name to `potential_3` and repeat the command
execution:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  land=land_suitability  water=water_resources  natural=protected_areas  potential=potential_3

</div>

![Example of a recreation potential output map while using a MASK, a
land suitability map, a water resources map and a natural resources
map](images/r_estimap_recreation_potential_3.png)

While the `land` option accepts only one map as an input, both the
`water` and the `natural` options accept multiple maps as inputs. In
example, we add a second map named `bathing_water_quality` to the water
component and modify the output map name to `potential_4`:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  land=land_suitability  water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality  natural=protected_areas  potential=potential_4

</div>

In general, arbitrary number of maps, separated by comma, may be added
to options that accept multiple inputs.

![Example of a recreation potential output map while using a MASK, a
land suitability map, two water resources maps and a natural resources
map](images/r_estimap_recreation_potential_4.png)

This example, features also a title and a legend, so as to make sense of
the map.

<div class="code">

    d.rast  potential_4
    d.legend  -c  -b  potential_4  at=0,15,0,1  border_color=white
    d.text  text="Potential"  bgcolor=white

</div>

The different output map names are purposefully selected so as to enable
a visual comparison of the differences among the differenct examples.
The output maps `potential_1`, `potential_2`, `potential_3` and
`potential_4` range within \[0,3\]. Yet, they differ in the distribution
of values due to the different set of input maps.

All of the above examples base upon pre-processed maps that score the
access to and quality of land, water and natural resources. For using
*raw*, unprocessed maps, read section **Using unprocessed maps**.

#### Spectrum

To derive a map with the recreation (opportunity) `spectrum`, we need in
addition an `infrastructure` component. In this example a map that
scores distance to infrastructure (such as the road network) named
`distance_to_infrastructure` is defined as an input:

![Example of an input map showing distances to
infrastructure](images/r_estimap_recreation_distance_to_infrastructure.png)

Naturally, we need to define the output map option `spectrum` too:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  \
      land=land_suitability \
      water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality \
      natural=protected_areas \
      infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure
      spectrum=spectrum  \

</div>

or, the same command in a copy-paste friendly way:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  land=land_suitability  water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality  natural=protected_areas  infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure  spectrum=spectrum

</div>

![Example of a recreation spectrum output map while using a MASK, a land
suitability map, a water resources map and a natural resources
map](images/r_estimap_recreation_spectrum.png)

Missing to define the `infrastructure` map, the command will abort and
inform about.

The image above, was produced via the following native GRASS GIS
commands

<div class="code">

    d.rast  spectrum
    d.legend  -c  -b  spectrum  at=0,30,0,1  border_color=white
    d.text  text="Spectrum"  bgcolor=white

</div>

##### Opportunity

The `opportunity` map is actually an intermediate step of the algorithm.
The option to output this map `opportunity` is meant for expert users
who want to explore the fundamentals of the processing steps. Hence, it
requires to define the output option `spectrum` map as well. Building
upon the previous command, we add the `opportunity` output option:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  \
      mask=area_of_interest \
      land=land_suitability \
      water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality \
      natural=protected_areas \
      spectrum=spectrum  \
      infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure \
      opportunity=opportunity

</div>

or, the same command in a copy-paste friendly way:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  mask=area_of_interest  land=land_suitability  water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality  natural=protected_areas  spectrum=spectrum  infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure  opportunity=opportunity

</div>

![Example of a recreation spectrum output map while using a MASK, a land
suitability map, a water resources map and a natural resources
map](images/r_estimap_recreation_opportunity.png)

#### More input maps

To derive the outputs met `demand` distributiom, `unmet` demand
distributiom and the actual `flow`, additional requirements are a
`population` map and one of boundaries, as an input to the option
`base`, within which to quantify the distribution of the population.
Using a map of administrative boundaries for the latter option, serves
for deriving comparable figures across these boundaries. The algorithm
sets internally the spatial resolution of all related output maps
`demand`, `unmet` and `flow` to the spatial resolution of the
`population` input map.

Population

![Fragment of a population map (GHSL, 2015)](images/r_estimap_recreation_population_2015.png)

In this example, the population map named `population_2015` is of
1000m\^2.

Local administrative units

![Fragment of a local administrative units input
map](images/r_estimap_recreation_local_administrative_units.png)

The map named `local_administrative_units` serves in the following
example as the base map for the zonal statistics to obtain the demand
map.

#### Demand

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation --o \
      mask=area_of_interest \
      land=land_suitability \
      water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality \
      natural=protected_areas \
      infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure \
      demand=demand \
      population=population_2015 \
      base=local_administrative_units

</div>

![Example of a demand distribution output map while using a MASK and
inputs for land suitability, water resources, natural resources,
infrastructure, population and base](images/r_estimap_recreation_demand.png)

#### Unmet Demand

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation --o \
      mask=area_of_interest \
      land=land_suitability \
      water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality \
      natural=protected_areas \
      infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure \
      demand=demand \
      unmet=unmet_demand \
      population=population_2015 \
      base=local_administrative_units

</div>

![Example of an 'unmet demand' output map while using a MASK and inputs
for land suitability, water resources, natural resources,
infrastructure, population and base](images/r_estimap_recreation_unmet_demand.png)

#### Mobility

The *mobility* bases upon the same function used to quantify the
attractiveness of locations for their recreational value. It includes an
extra *score* term.

The computation involves a *distance* map, reclassified in 5 categories
as shown in the following table. For each distance category, a unique
pair of coefficient values is assigned to the basic equation.

<div class="tg-wrap">

  Distance   Kappa     Alpha
  ---------- --------- ---------
  0 to 1     0.02350   0.00102
  1 to 2     0.02651   0.00109
  2 to 3     0.05120   0.00098
  3 to 4     0.10700   0.00067
  &gt;4      0.06930   0.00057

</div>

Note, the last distance category is not considered in deriving the final
"map of visits". The output is essentially a raster map with the
distribution of the demand per distance category and within predefined
geometric boundaries

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation --o \
      mask=area_of_interest \
      land=land_suitability \
      water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality \
      natural=protected_areas \
      infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure \
      mobility=mobility \
      population=population_2015 \
      base=local_administrative_units

</div>

![Example of a mobility output map while using a MASK and inputs for
land suitability, water resources, natural resources, infrastructure,
population and base](images/r_estimap_recreation_mobility.png)

#### All in one call

Of course it is possible to derive all output maps with one call:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation --o  \
      mask=area_of_interest  \
      land=land_suitability  \
      water=water_resources,bathing_water_quality  \
      natural=protected_areas  \
      infrastructure=distance_to_infrastructure  \
      potential=potential  \
      opportunity=opportunity  \
      spectrum=spectrum  \
      demand=demand  \
      unmet=unmet_demand  \
      mobility=mobility  \
      population=population_2015  \
      base=local_administrative_units
      timestamp='2018'

</div>

Note the use of the `timestamp` parameter! This concerns the `spectrum`
map. If plans include working with GRASS GIS' temporal framework on
time-series, this will be useful.

### Using unprocessed input maps

The module offers a pre-processing functionality for all of the
following input components:

-   landuse
-   suitability\_scores

<!-- -->

-   landcover
-   land\_classes

<!-- -->

-   lakes
-   lakes\_coefficients
-   default is set to: euclidean,1,30,0.008,1

<!-- -->

-   coastline
-   coastline\_coefficients
-   default is set to: euclidean,1,30,0.008,1
-   coast\_geomorphology

<!-- -->

-   bathing\_water
-   bathing\_coefficients
-   default is set to: euclidean,1,5,0.01101

<!-- -->

-   protected
-   protected\_scores
-   11:11:0,12:12:0.6,2:2:0.8,3:3:0.6,4:4:0.6,5:5:1,6:6:0.8,7:7:0,8:8:0,9:9:0

<!-- -->

-   anthropic
-   anthropic\_distances
-   0:500:1,500.000001:1000:2,1000.000001:5000:3,5000.000001:10000:4,10000.00001:\*:5

<!-- -->

-   roads
-   roads\_distances
-   0:500:1,500.000001:1000:2,1000.000001:5000:3,5000.000001:10000:4,10000.00001:\*:5

A first look on how this works, is to experiment with the `landuse` and
`suitability_scores` input options.

Let's return to the first example, and use a fragment from the
unprocessed CORINE land data set, instead of the `land_suitability` map.
This requires a set of "score" rules, that correspond to the CORINE
nomenclature, to translate the land cover types into recreation
potential.

<div>

![Fragment from the CORINE land data base ](images/r_estimap_recreation_corine_land_cover_2006.png)
![Legend for the CORINE land data base](images/r_estimap_recreation_corine_land_cover_legend.png)

</div>

In this case, the rules are a simple ASCII file (for example named
`corine_suitability.scores` that contains the following

<div class="code">

    1:1:0:0
    2:2:0.1:0.1
    3:9:0:0
    10:10:1:1
    11:11:0.1:0.1
    12:13:0.3:0.3
    14:14:0.4:0.4
    15:17:0.5:0.5
    18:18:0.6:0.6
    19:20:0.3:0.3
    21:22:0.6:0.6
    23:23:1:1
    24:24:0.8:0.8
    25:25:1:1
    26:29:0.8:0.8
    30:30:1:1
    31:31:0.8:0.8
    32:32:0.7:0.7
    33:33:0:0
    34:34:0.8:0.8
    35:35:1:1
    36:36:0.8:0.8
    37:37:1:1
    38:38:0.8:0.8
    39:39:1:1
    40:42:1:1
    43:43:0.8:0.8
    44:44:1:1
    45:45:0.3:0.3

</div>

This file is provided in the `suitability_scores` option:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  landuse=corine_land_cover_2006 suitability_scores=corine_suitability.scores  potential=potential_corine --o

</div>

![Example of a recreation spectrum output map while using a MASK, based
on a fragment from the CORINE land data base](images/r_estimap_recreation_potential_corine.png)

The same can be achieved with a long one-line string too:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation \
      landuse=corine_land_cover_2006 \
      suitability_scores="1:1:0:0,2:2:0.1:0.1,3:9:0:0,10:10:1:1,11:11:0.1:0.1,12:13:0.3:0.3,14:14:0.4:0.4,15:17:0.5:0.5,18:18:0.6:0.6,19:20:0.3:0.3,21:22:0.6:0.6,23:23:1:1,24:24:0.8:0.8,25:25:1:1,26:29:0.8:0.8,30:30:1:1,31:31:0.8:0.8,32:32:0.7:0.7,33:33:0:0,34:34:0.8:0.8,35:35:1:1,36:36:0.8:0.8,37:37:1:1,38:38:0.8:0.8,39:39:1:1,40:42:1:1,43:43:0.8:0.8,44:44:1:1,45:45:0.3:0.3"  potential=potential_1 --o

</div>

In fact, this very scoring scheme, for CORINE land data sets, is
integrated in the module, so we obtain the same output even by
discarding the `suitability_scores` option:

<div class="code">

    r.estimap.recreation  landuse=corine_land_cover_2006  suitability_scores=corine_suitability.scores  potential=potential_1 --o

</div>

This is so because CORINE is a standard choice among existing land data
bases that cover european territories. In case of a user requirement to
provide an alternative scoring scheme, all what is required is either of

-   provide a new "rules" file with the desired set of scoring rules
-   provide a string to the `suitability_scores` option
